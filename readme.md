## <a name="three"><h1>Long Polling + Data Storage</h1></a>

### Description

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2018/05/ebd5ebac-kd31.png" width="350">

Long Polling is a technique where the client sends a request to the server and waits for a response. The server holds the request open until it has new data to send back or until a timeout occurs. Long Polling is a low-overhead approach suitable for projects with a low volume of clients and a low frequency of updates.

## <a name="jwt"><h1>JWT</h1></a>

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Although JWTs can be encrypted to also provide secrecy between parties, we will focus on signed tokens.
